## 🛑 Project Status: Archived

After a lot of thought, **Disutils Team has officially concluded active development**.

This repository — and the organization as a whole — now exists in an **archived / maintenance-only** state.

### What this means:
- ✅ Final commission has been completed
- ✅ Existing public bots **remain online**
- 🔒 Only **security patches** and **critical fixes** will be applied
- ❌ No new features, bots, or commissions
- ❌ No active recruitment or roadmap

This is **not** due to failure or burnout — it’s simply the right stopping point.

## 🧠 What We Built

In a short time, Disutils grew into something far bigger than expected:

- **1,500+ Discord servers**
- **150,000+ users reached**
- Multiple verified bots
- Full backend, infra, branding, and security stack
- Real-world experience across:
  - Discord bot engineering
  - Infrastructure & Linux
  - Security hardening
  - Community management
  - Project leadership

We’re incredibly proud of what was built — and even more proud of what everyone learned along the way.

## ❤️ Thank You

To every contributor, tester, supporter, sponsor, and user — **thank you**.

Disutils Team wouldn’t have existed without the people who showed up, put in effort, and believed in the vision.

> This project did exactly what it was meant to do.

## 📌 Final Notes

- Issues and PRs are disabled unless security-related  
- Repositories remain public for reference  
- This org stands as a snapshot of what we built together
